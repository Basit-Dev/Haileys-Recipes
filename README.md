# Hailey's Recipes

Hailey’s Recipes is a recipe website I built as part of my web development diploma. It's a simple site where you can search and explore different recipes.

##  What This Project Is

This website lets you:
- **Search for recipes** using keywords (like "chicken" or "vegan")
- **Filter recipes** by category (like "Dinner", "Breakfast", etc.)
- **View recipes** as cards with a picture, title, short description, and rating

I made it because I wanted to learn how to build websites that are both useful and nice to look at. It’s designed to work well on phones, tablets, and computers.

## What the Website Looks Like

### Search Bar
- Right near the top
- Type in what you’re looking for (like “pasta”) and it filters recipes right away

### Filter Buttons
- You can click buttons like:
  - All
  - Breakfast
  - Lunch
  - Dinner
  - Vegan
  - Quick & Easy  
- These help narrow down what you see

### Recipe Cards
- Each card shows:
  - A recipe picture
  - The name of the recipe
  - A short description
  - A category tag (like “Dinner”)

### Works on Any Device
- Whether you’re on your phone or laptop, the layout adjusts to fit your screen

## How It All Works

- **Search bar:** As you type, the list of recipes updates right away — no need to press Enter!
- **Filter buttons:** Just click one, and only recipes in that category will show
- **Load More:** Only a few recipes show at first — click the button to show more
- **Navigation bar:** Has links to different pages like Home, Categories, and About

## Where I Got Design Ideas

- Wep page designs by (https://dribbble.com)
- Markdown Guide by (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

These helped me figure out how to keep things simple and clean.

## What I Used to Build This

- **HTML** — for the structure
- **CSS** — for the styling
- **JavaScript** — to make it interactive
- **Figma** — to plan the design and layout
